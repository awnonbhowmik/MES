# MES
Modern Encryption Standard

An probable future alternative to AES.

As mathematical theory has evolved and computing
capabilities have improved, what initially seemed to be
adequately difficult trapdoor functions, were deemed not to be
later on. In this paper, a new block-encryption scheme named
Modern Encryption Standard (MES) is proposed based on the
multiple concepts arising from number theory for a highly
secure and fast cryptosystem that can be considered as an
alternative to the existing systems. This is a block cipher like
AES, but the inherent algorithm is quite different. The
security of the proposed MES algorithm stands on the
fundamentals of the Chinese Remainder Theorem, Cantor
Pairing Function and the Prime Number Theorem for creating
an ingenious trapdoor function. Breaking this algorithm
proves to be quite a daunting obstacle to overcome for an
unwelcome interceptor.
